N -> Items in shop = No of elements in array = arr[n]
X -> Discount = given
Y -> reduce from the cost of every element in array = arr[i]-Y
Condn -> If arr[i]<y therefore y=0


Total amount without coupan = arr[0]+arr[1]....+arr[n]
Total amount with coupn = arr[0] - y + arr[1] .... +arr[n]-y


Decide coupon or not coupon
If (Total amount with coupn  < Total amount without coupan)then COUPON
NOT COUPON 


1. Find the total sum of the array totalSum
2. Find total sum of array with discount totalSumWithDiscount
3. Check if (X+totalSumWithDiscount) < totalSum
    if yes : COUPON
    else : NOT COUPON

Q2) Cost of Groceries

N-> 2 
X-> 20
arr[A] -> 15 67 ( array of fresheness) 
arr[B] -> 10 90 ( prices )


n-> length of the array
x-> minimum freshness 
arr[a] -> array of freshness
arr[b] -> cost of the products 

1. Check the freshness is greater than the given freshness
2. reterive that freshness and get the prices of the element and return the total price
